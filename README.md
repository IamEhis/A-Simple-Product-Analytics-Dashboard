- **Revenue by Country**
Revenue distribution is fairly balanced across top-performing countries. Canada leads slightly with **\$613,913**, followed closely by the United States (**\$611,562**) and France (**\$610,709**). Mexico and Germany also contribute significantly with **\$560,048** and **\$558,375** respectively. This indicates strong sales coverage across North America and Europe, with opportunities to grow further in emerging markets.

- **Revenue by Year and Date**
The timeline analysis reveals consistent revenue growth across 2022 and 2023, with total monthly sales peaking in certain quarters. This year-on-year performance highlights positive momentum in both revenue and units sold, with **8% YoY growth in units** and **7% YoY profit increase**.

- **Discount Band Breakdown**
A significant portion of sales occurs in **High (34.93%)** and **Medium (34.52%)** discount bands, while **Low discounts account for 23.93%**. Only **6.61%** of transactions occur without a discount.
